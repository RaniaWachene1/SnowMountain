## 🔹 **Pipeline Highlights**
- 🗂️ **Source Code Management**: Using GitHub for seamless version control and collaboration.
- 🔄 **Continuous Integration**: Automated with Jenkins to manage builds, tests, and deployments.
- 🔍 **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks scans for sensitive data leaks, ensuring security from the very beginning.
- 🛠️ **Build Automation & Testing**: Leveraging Maven, JUnit, and Mockito for reliable, automated backend builds and tests.
- 🛡️ **Code Quality & Security**: SonarQube and OWASP Dependency Check keep code quality high and dependencies secure.
- 🐳 **Containerization**: Dockerized both backend and frontend, managed by Docker Hub and Nexus as a private Docker registry.
- 🔗 **Multi-Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose organizes services for integration tests.
- 📜 **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform provisions infrastructure on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalable, cloud-based deployments.
- 📈 **Continuous Monitoring**: Integrated Trivy for filesystem and image vulnerability scans, with real-time notifications 📧 through Gmail.
